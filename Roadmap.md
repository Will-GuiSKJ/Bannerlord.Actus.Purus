# Roadmap

## Guidelines
This roadmap details the features intended to be included in Bannerlord Actus Purus. Not all features have been evaluated for feasibility.

### Localization
I plan to provide support for both EN-GB and PT-BR. If anyone would also like to contribute with localization strings, please contact me.

### New Quests & Dialogues
1. Add new quests, including fleshing out minor factions
	1. Beduin Trouble: Questline for the Jawwal involving a merchant wanting retribution for poached caravans
	1. Captive Betrayer: Questline for the Legion of the Betrayed involving rescuing one of its former Legates now held prisoner by the Norther Empire
	
### Unique Custom Wanderers
New handful of unique wanderers with unique backstories, unique opinions on player actions and unique questlines that unlock new Focus Points based on player input.

### Crisis
1. Famine
1. Plague
1. Long Winters
1. Foreign Invasion
	1. Shogunate Invasion
	1. Viking Invasion
	1. Nubian Invasion

### Skills

#### Leadership
1. Every (N)PC in an army receives small XP if army leader has a higher Leadership skill level and (N)PC has high relationship with leader. This simulates (N)PCs being in the leader's "inner circle"
	1. Extra XP if (N)PC has high Charm skill level

#### Tactics
1. Every (N)PC in an army receives small skill XP if army leader has a higher Tactics skill level and (N)PC has high relationship with leader. This simulates (N)PCs being in the leader's "inner circle"
	1. Extra XP if (N)PC has high Charm skill level

### AI

#### Ars Imperatoria (Long-term)
Faction Leader's create war plans when war is declared and communicates to all vassals, including PC.  
Possible goals:
1. Border extension - Capture clump of Settlements, likely chosen when 2+ settlements near Faction's border are easily capturable
1. Economical warfare - Focus on village raids and caravans (Favourite of Sturgia), likely chosen when vassals are impoverished
1. War of attrition - Focus on destroying parties and take prisoners, likely chosen when neighboring faction has large number parties

### Kingdom

#### Castles vs. Towns
Castles and Towns should feel different to each other and provide different advantages.
1. Towns should be commercial centres and provide the bulk of taxes
	1. High criminal strength affects prosperity and siphons away taxes. High Roguery lords receive a taxation bonus however, to simulate politcal corruption
1. Castles are military centres and provide high-level troops and access to noble lines, but reduced taxes
	1. Castles have an area of influence that warring parties, while inside, become susceptible to ambush by Castle garrison, affected by Scout skill level of castle governor
1. Castles, and Towns with a smithy, can provide forging services (crafting by proxy) to PC for a price

#### Kingdom management (Long-term)
1. Extra tab in Kingdom screen for Military and Economical summaries of owned fiefs

#### Religion (Long-term)
1. Each faction has its own religion, with all 3 Empire factions sharing the same religion
1. Small relation gain penalty for having different religion
1. Settlements with a Lord/Governor that has a different religion than populace applies penalty to loyalty
1. Ability to forcefully convert settlement to Lord's religion
1. Religius pressure between settlements

#### Multi-faction Treaties (Long-term)
1. Trade - Faction caravans give preference (and gain bonus money) to trade routes to factions in treaty
1. Defense - Factions will enter war to protect each other
1. Non Agression - Factions will not go to war with each other
