# Roadmap

1. Castles vs. Towns
	a. Towns are commercial centres and provide the bulk of taxes
		x. Add more things to do with the underworld
		y. Towns have worst militia vs. troop ratio
		z. Towns have bigger garrisons
	b. Castles are military centres and provide high-level troops and noble lines, but reduced taxes
		x. Certain castles provide more unique troops
		y. Castles have better defenses, morale and resistance to starving
		z. Castles have better troop vs. militia ratio
		v. Castles have an area of influence that warring parties are succeptible to ambush by Castle garrison, affected by Scout skill of army leader and castle governor. If numbers are unfavoralble, Castles will lead attrition warfare designed to slow down invading armies and/or remove food
	c. Castles and Towns with a smithy can provide forging services (crafting by proxy)
	d. Projects should not just be extra stas but unlock new features, such as crafting by proxy
	e. Governors should matter more and not be stationary, maybe lead parties from garrison to patrol. Lesser vassals can be set as governors instead of gifting the whole fief.
		

2. Kingdom management
	a. Extra tab in kingdom management for Military and Economical summaries
		x. Overall military and economic health of kingdom
		y. Per fief status
	b. Mercenary money for doing more good for the kingdom

		x. Companions as vassals

3. Auto-resolve logic
	a. Field battles
	b. Sieges
		x. Defenders and Attackers divided into Infantary and Artillery
		y. Every round, as many units as possible resolve. Defenders first.
		z. Siege devided between Approach and Attack
			1. In approach, infantary set ladders, move ram/towers. More infantary means this is done quicker.
			2. During approach, defending artillary attack infantary+seige weapons while attacking artillary defend
			3. Siege weapons are very powerful artillary actors
			4. Ladders and towers provide a set amount of troops onto the wall. Attacking infantary can only attack once inside the castle.
			5. Battering ram creates another pathway into the castle once gate is destroyed
			6. Defending crossbowman get a bonus to attack
			7. Units weapons are decided by skill. All mounted units dismount. Noone should use polearms.
			8. Damage/defense is calulated based on weapon + weapon skill (optimum swing animation) and armor + athletics skill. Maybe targeted body damage, probabilty based on skill
