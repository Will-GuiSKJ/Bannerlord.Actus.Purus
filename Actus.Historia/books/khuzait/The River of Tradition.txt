From the oral traditions of the Karakhergit:

Once, in the heart of the Khuzait lands, there flowed a great river. Its waters were cool and clear, and its path stretched far across the steppe, nourishing all who dwelt there. The river's waters held the ancient wisdom and traditions of the Khuzait people, passed down from generation to generation.

We, The Karakhergit, lived by the banks of the river. We revered its waters and drank deeply from them, taking in the ancient knowledge and strength they held. The river's waters kept us connected to the wisdom of our ancestors and the Great Sky Father, Ülken.

One day, a group of travelers came to the river's edge. They hailed from distant lands and brought with them strange new beliefs and ideas. Intrigued by the river's beauty, they began swim in the river's waters. As they did so, the waters began to change, taking on a different hue and taste.

Curious, other Khuzait clans began to drink from the altered waters, finding new flavors and insights that they had never known before. Soon, many of the clans abandoned the pure waters of tradition, choosing instead to drink from the mingled waters of change.

We, however, refused to let the river's altered waters touch our lips. We saw the dangers of losing our ancestral wisdom and feared that the foreign ideas would dilute the strength of our people. So, we retreated further upstream, where the waters still ran pure and clear, and continued to honor the traditions of our forebears.

As time passed, the other clans began to forget the old ways, and their connection to Ülken and the spirits of nature began to fade. But the Karakhergit remained steadfast, preserving the wisdom and strength of our ancestors.
