From the oral traditions of the Khuzait:

Long ago, our people lived in harmony with nature under the watchful gaze of the Great Sky Father, Ülken. Their days were filled with hunting and tending to their flocks, and their nights were spent sharing stories around the fire. Life was simple, but it was good. However, their peaceful existence would soon be threatened by a fearsome monster that emerged from the depths of the earth.

This monstrous beast, known as Korkyt, had the body of a lion and the wings of a great eagle. It roamed the vast grasslands, leaving destruction in its wake. We tried to defend their homes and families, but they were no match for Korkyt's strength and ferocity. Desperate for help, our people prayed to Ülken for protection.

Moved by their pleas, Ülken decided to intervene. He searched among our people for the bravest and most skilled warrior, a man named Altay. In a dream, Ülken spoke to Altay, instructing him to climb the highest peak in the land at dawn. Altay obeyed, scaling the mountain as the first light of day broke across the sky.

At the summit, Altay found himself standing before Ülken, who had descended from the heavens. Ülken bestowed upon Altay a celestial bow and a quiver of arrows, infused with the power of the sky. He told Altay that with these divine weapons, he would be able to defeat Korkyt and save his people.

Altay thanked Ülken and descended the mountain, carrying the celestial bow and arrows. He gathered our people and shared with them the divine message he had received. Together, they devised a plan to lure Korkyt into a trap.

We set out a grand feast, leaving it in a clearing in the grasslands. As they had anticipated, the scent of the food attracted Korkyt. The beast swooped down from the sky to devour the offering. Altay, hidden in the shadows, took aim with his celestial bow, and as Korkyt feasted, he let loose an arrow.

The arrow struck Korkyt in the heart, and the beast let out a terrible roar as it fell to the earth, lifeless. Our people rejoiced in their victory, lifting Altay upon their shoulders and praising his bravery.

In the years that followed, Altay became a legendary figure among our people. His descendants continued to protect their land and people, becoming the first noble warriors of the Khuzait people. As a reminder of their bond with Ülken and their divine purpose, each generation of warriors would recount the tale of Altay and the celestial bow, honoring the Great Sky Father for his benevolence and protection.
