From the oral traditions of the Khuzait:

Long ago, in the heart of the steppe, there was a chieftain named Kagan, known for his wisdom, strength, and skill in leading his people. His tribe prospered, and as time passed, Kagan felt the need to find a wife who could stand beside him and help guide their people toward a bright future.

One day, while Kagan was out hunting, he came across a beautiful woman named Aylin. She was the daughter of a neighboring chieftain, and their meeting seemed like fate. Over time, they grew to love one another, and Kagan knew that Aylin was the one he wanted to share his life with.

Before Kagan could ask for Aylin's hand in marriage, he sought counsel from the Kut Shaman of his tribe. The wise shaman told Kagan of the importance of the sacred union, a bond forged by Ülken, the Great Sky Father, and blessed by the spirits of nature. The shaman explained that a true marriage was not only a joining of two people but also a union of their souls, destined to last for all eternity.

Armed with this knowledge, Kagan approached Aylin's father, expressing his desire to marry her and promising to honor and protect her for the rest of their lives. Aylin's father, impressed by Kagan's sincerity and wisdom, agreed to the union and preparations for the wedding began.

The day of the wedding arrived, and the entire tribe gathered to witness the sacred ceremony. The Kut Shaman led Kagan and Aylin through the rituals, invoking the blessings of Ülken and the spirits of nature. The couple exchanged vows, pledging their love and loyalty to one another, and promising to uphold the principles of the Ülkentan faith.

As Kagan and Aylin were pronounced husband and wife, a gentle breeze swept through the gathering, and the people knew that the spirits of nature had bestowed their blessings upon the couple. The tribe celebrated with feasting, singing, and dancing, their joy echoing across the vast steppe.

From that day on, Kagan and Aylin ruled their people with wisdom and compassion, their love for one another serving as a shining example for their tribe. Their marriage became a cornerstone of the Ülkentan faith, a symbol of the sacred bond between two souls that could never be broken.
