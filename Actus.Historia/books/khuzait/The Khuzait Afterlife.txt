From the oral traditions of the Khuzait:

In the days of old, when the Ülkentan faith was still young, the Khuzait people would often ponder the mysteries of life and death. We, the Kut Shamans, sought wisdom from Ülken, the Great Sky Father. It was during this time that the Khuzaits began to understand the concept of the afterlife.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and twilight began to settle upon the steppe, a brave warrior named Argan sat by a dying fire. He was troubled, for he had recently lost his father in battle, and he could not find solace in the belief that his father's spirit would continue to wander the earth. Argan sought answers, and so he prayed to Ülken for guidance.

Moved by Argan's grief and sincerity, Ülken appeared before him in a vision. The Great Sky Father told Argan of the realm beyond the mortal world, where the spirits of the dead would reside. This place was called Altyr, a vast, endless steppe that mirrored the beauty and grandeur of the earthly realm.

Ülken explained that in Altyr, the spirits of the Khuzait people would be reunited with their ancestors, living together in harmony and peace. The faithful would be rewarded with lush grasslands for their horses, and the air would be filled with the music of the wind and the laughter of their loved ones.

However, Ülken also spoke of the warrior's path, a special place in Altyr reserved for those who had displayed exceptional courage, honor, and skill in battle. These great warriors would be honored with eternal glory, riding with Ülken across the endless skies and continuing to serve as protectors of their people.

Argan listened intently, his heart swelling with pride and hope at the thought of his father residing in such a glorious place. As the vision of Ülken faded, Argan felt a renewed sense of purpose and vowed to honor his father's memory by following the path of the warrior.

Argan's story spread throughout the Khuzait tribes, and our people embraced the idea of Altyr and the warrior's path. This belief in the afterlife gives us comfort and solace in times of loss and grief, and it serves as a constant reminder of the importance of honor, valor, and the bond between the living and the dead.
