From the lips of women Kut Shaman:

--------------------------------

Hush now, little one, close your eyes,
Rest your head, and listen to the skies.
Ülken's watching over you, so sweet,
As you drift into a gentle sleep.

Out upon the steppe, the horses run,
Beneath the silver moon and golden sun.
Dream, my child, of the wind's sweet song,
Carrying you to a place where you belong.

Hush now, little one, do not weep,
For in the land of dreams, you'll safely keep.
And when the morning sun does rise,
You'll awaken to the steppe's clear skies.

--------------------------------

Oh, child of the steppe, so strong and free,
Boundless as the sky and the endless sea.
May you grow to be brave and true,
Guided by Ülken's light, shining through.

Ride with the wind, my little one,
Race with the horses, beneath the sun.
Learn from the earth, the fire, and the rain,
For they hold the secrets of the ancient plain.

Oh, child of the Khuzait, you are the key,
To a future bright with hope and unity.
Hold fast to the wisdom passed down through the years,
And remember the tales that your heart endears.

--------------------------------

Dance, my child, with the spirits of the land,
Hand in hand, in a circle we stand.
We sing to the spirits of fire and of air,
Of earth and of water, with voices so fair.

Dance, my child, with the horses so free,
As they prance and they gallop, so wild and so fleet.
Their spirits are strong, they protect and they guide,
With their hearts so full of courage and pride.

Dance, my child, to the rhythm of the drum,
As we honor the Great Sky Father, our Ülken, our sun.
We dance for our ancestors, we dance for our kin,
For the unity of the Khuzait people, our spirit within.
