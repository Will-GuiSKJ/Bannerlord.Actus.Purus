From the oral traditions of the Khuzait:

Long ago, when the world was still young and the steppe vast and untamed, the Khuzait people lived as simple herders, tending to their herds and surviving off the land. They had yet to discover the power that would make them renowned throughout the lands.

One day, a young Khuzait herder named Temir ventured far from his village in search of a lost foal. As he searched, he came upon a magnificent stallion, unlike any he had ever seen. The horse's coat was as black as night, and its mane shimmered like silver in the moonlight.

As Temir approached the stallion, he noticed that the horse bore a strange marking on its forehead: the symbol of Ülken, the Great Sky Father. Intrigued, Temir approached the horse and, to his surprise, it allowed him to climb onto its back.

The moment he mounted the horse, Temir felt a surge of power and a deep connection with the majestic creature. As they rode together, Temir discovered that the horse was no ordinary steed. It could run faster than the wind itself and seemed to know Temir's every thought and desire.

One day, while riding the stallion, Temir stumbled upon a group of invaders threatening his village. Without thinking, he drew his bow and loosed an arrow, striking down one of the attackers. The other invaders, frightened by Temir's sudden appearance and his swift, deadly accuracy, fled in terror.

As Temir continued to ride the stallion, he discovered that the horse had bestowed upon him an extraordinary gift: the ability to shoot arrows with unmatched precision while riding at full speed. Realizing the potential of this newfound skill, Temir returned to his village and shared the knowledge with his people.

Under Temir's guidance, the our people honed their skill in horse archery, becoming the most feared and respected warriors of the steppe. As the generations passed, we continue to refine our mastery of both horse and archery, ensuring that the legacy of Temir and the divine stallion lives on.

And so, the Khuzait people became known as the Windriders, our warriors swift and deadly as the wind itself, striking fear into the hearts of our enemies and earning the favor of the Great Sky Father, Ülken.
