From the oral traditions of the Khuzait:

As the Khuzait Khanate continued to grow and interact with the people of the Calradic Empire, news of the Aetherist gods began to spread across the steppe. Among these foreign deities were Bellator, the god of war and valor, and Fecundia, the goddess of fertility and agriculture. We, a people of warriors and horsemen, found ourselves drawn to these powerful and mysterious gods.

One day, a great gathering of Kut Shamans and chieftains from various Khuzait tribes convened to discuss these new gods and determine their place within the Ülkentan faith. As they debated and shared their thoughts, a powerful storm rolled across the steppe. Dark clouds gathered overhead, and fierce winds howled around the gathering.

Suddenly, two figures appeared in the midst of the storm. One was a tall, muscular man clad in armor, his eyes burning with the fires of battle. He was Bellator, the god of war, come to prove his might to the Khuzaits. With a great roar, he summoned the storm's fury and commanded the winds, demonstrating his power and mastery over the elements.

The other figure was a beautiful woman with flowing hair, dressed in robes adorned with symbols of the harvest. She was Fecundia, the goddess of fertility and agriculture, and she brought with her the promise of bountiful harvests and the growth of the Khuzait people. As she stepped forward, the storm abated, and the wind calmed, giving way to a gentle rain that nurtured the earth beneath their feet.

The Kut Shamans and chieftains were awestruck by the power and grace of these new gods. They recognized that Bellator and Fecundia embodied aspects of life that were important to the Khuzait people – the warrior spirit and the nurturing of the land. The gathering agreed that these gods were worthy of reverence and should be incorporated into the Ülkentan faith.

From that day forward, the Khuzaits have honored Bellator and Fecundia alongside Ülken and the spirits of nature. To this day. we hold great festivals to celebrate the gods' arrival, with contests of strength and skill to honor Bellator, and feasts of the harvest to give thanks to Fecundia.
