From the oral traditions of the Khuzait:

In the early days of the Khuzait people, before they had tamed the wild horses of the steppe, life was much harder. Hunting in the steppe was a difficult task.

One day, a young Khuzait named Aybars was out hunting in the steppe when he became separated from his companions. Lost and weary, Aybars found himself at the edge of a great canyon, where he decided to rest. As he sat on the cliff's edge, he heard the sound of hoofbeats approaching. Turning to look, he saw a magnificent white horse with a shimmering mane and tail that seemed to dance like the wind.

Captivated by the horse's beauty, Aybars approached it cautiously. As he drew nearer, he noticed that the horse's eyes held a wisdom and cunning that could only come from the spirits. In that moment, he realized that this was no ordinary horse; it was a gift from Ülken and the spirits of nature.

Feeling a deep connection with the horse, Aybars extended his hand, and the horse allowed him to touch its soft muzzle. In that moment, their souls became intertwined, and Aybars felt a sudden understanding of the horse's thoughts and emotions.

Aybars led the horse back to his village, where he shared his story with his people. He taught them how to approach the wild horses of the steppe with respect and understanding, forging a bond between the people and the horses that would come to define our way of life.

As we learned to tame and ride the horses, our lives were forever changed. Our people rode our horses like the wind, becoming the greatest hunters of the grassland and united our tribes across the steppes. We should always be grateful to Ülken and the spirits of nature for their gift, and honor the Spirit of the Horse in our daily lives.

Throughout the years, the story of Aybars and the Spirit of the Horse has been told much as I tell it now. It serves as a reminder of our deep connection with the natural world, and the importance of respecting and cherishing the gifts bestowed upon us by Ülken and the spirits of nature.

To this day, we continue to honor the Spirit of the Horse, revering the magnificent creatures that have shaped us. Remeber, that each horse carries within it the spirit of the first horse, the one that brought Aybars the knowledge and power to tame the wild horses of the steppe. And it is in this sacred bond that we find their strength, unity, and identity as the people of the horse.
