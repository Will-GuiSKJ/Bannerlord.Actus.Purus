From the oral traditions of the Khuzait:

In the beginning, there was only the endless sky, and within it, the Great Sky Father, Ülken. Ülken was lonely, so he decided to create the world beneath the vast sky. He descended upon the formless earth and shaped the mountains, rivers, and plains, breathing life into the animals and plants.

One day, Ülken saw his reflection in a still pool of water, and from that reflection, he created the first man and woman, naming them Tural and Ekin. Ülken taught Tural and Ekin how to hunt, grow crops, and build shelters to survive in the new world he had created for them. Tural and Ekin, grateful for their existence and the bountiful world around them, began to worship the Great Sky Father and honor the spirits of nature, including the earth, water, fire, and wind, as well as the spirits of animals, particularly horses.

As Tural and Ekin prospered and their family grew, they understood the interconnectedness of all things, both living and non-living, and the importance of maintaining balance and harmony within the world. Their descendants, the first Khuzaits, spread across the land, each generation passing down the stories of their ancestors and their reverence for the Great Sky Father, Ülken.

However, life was not always peaceful for the Khuzaits. The world was filled with dangerous spirits and rival tribes that sought to disrupt their harmony. But Tural and Ekin's descendants, guided by their personal honor and valor, were able to overcome the challenges they faced. Great warriors and leaders among them earned a special place in the afterlife, their stories becoming an integral part of our faith.
