From The Codex Aetherium:

Once, in a quaint village within the Calradic Empire, there was a humble stone lying on the side of the road. This stone was nothing extraordinary, small and weathered, easily overlooked by passersby. However, it had a secret: it was a gift from Scientia, the goddess of knowledge and learning.

One day, a young girl named Eirene discovered the stone while walking to the market. Intrigued by its simplicity, she picked it up and felt an inexplicable warmth in her hand. Unaware of its divine origin, Eirene brought the stone home, placing it on a small shelf in her room.

As days went by, Eirene found herself drawn to the stone, spending hours gazing at it, pondering life's mysteries. The stone seemed to whisper wisdom into her ears, inspiring her to learn more about the world around her. Over time, Eirene became known in the village for her extraordinary knowledge and wisdom.

Word of Eirene's remarkable intellect spread throughout the Calradic Empire, eventually reaching the imperial court. One day, Emperor Arenicos himself summoned her to share her wisdom. Humbled by the honor, Eirene brought the stone with her to the court.

When Eirene arrived, the emperor was eager to test her knowledge. He asked her many difficult questions, but she answered them all with grace and wisdom. Impressed, Emperor Arenicos inquired about the source of her insight. Eirene, without hesitation, showed him the humble stone.

As Emperor Arenicos held the stone in his hand, he felt the same warmth that Eirene had felt. Realizing that the stone was a gift from Scientia herself, he declared it a sacred object and vowed to use its wisdom to lead the empire justly.

With Eirene's guidance and the wisdom of the humble stone, Emperor Arenicos led the Calradic Empire into an era of prosperity and enlightenment. Eirene, having served her purpose, returned to her village, leaving the stone with the emperor as a reminder of the divine wisdom that guided them both.
