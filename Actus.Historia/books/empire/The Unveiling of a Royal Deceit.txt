Citizens of the Calradic Empire, lend me your ears! The time has come to reveal the hidden truth that has been shrouded in deceit and false legitimacy. Emperor Arenicos, may he rest in peace, failed to name an heir to the throne, casting a shadow upon the fate of our great empire. Yet, there are those who claim that his daughter, Ira, is the rightful heir, despite the absence of any official proclamation.

Let it be known that Ira's claim to the throne is shrouded in doubt and speculation. Her mother, the Empress Raghae, has been a master manipulator, weaving a web of lies to ensure her own power and influence. Our sources have uncovered shocking revelations that cast doubt upon the true parentage of Ira. Could she be a pawn in Raghae's grand scheme to seize control of the empire?

It is no secret that Emperor Arenicos had many enemies and rivals throughout his reign. The refusal to name an heir can be seen as a calculated move, designed to protect his family from those who would seek to undermine them. However, it has also left the door open for Raghae and Ira to capitalize on this ambiguity and force their way into the seat of power.

Consider the miraculous tales of the Aetherist faith, stories of divine favor and intervention that have been used to bolster Ira's claim. Are these not merely fables, crafted by the cunning Empress to sway the hearts and minds of the people? We must question the legitimacy of these tales, for they serve as the very foundation upon which Ira's claim to the throne is built.

As loyal subjects of the Calradic Empire, we must stand united against this deceitful plot. We cannot allow the throne to be usurped by those who would exploit our faith and manipulate the truth for their own gain. The future of our great empire depends on our vigilance, our courage, and our unwavering dedication to the truth.

Spread the word, fellow citizens, and let the truth be known. We must stand together and demand clarity in the face of uncertainty. The rightful heir to the throne must be chosen by the gods and the Senate, not by the cunning schemes of a power-hungry empress. The future of the Calradic Empire hangs in the balance, and it is up to us to ensure that justice prevails.
