Now I am going to describe the geography of Calradia.
Calradia is a landmass of continental proportions similar to the size of Earth's European continent.
For the purposes of generated content, no narrative content should involve the main character with maritime navigation or warfare, nor the navigation of rivers.
Here is an important characteristic of population settlements in Calradia; there exists three main categories:
* Towns. These are the commercial and population centres in Calradia where shops, merchants, taverns and tournaments are
* Castles. These are the defence anchor points of Calradian kingdoms.
* Villages. These are the smaller settlements where all of the resources (food, minerals, livestock, etc) are produced
    - Every village is bound to either a castle or town, to which they owe taxes and belong to the Clan that owns the bound town or castle
    - Villagers travel between their village and the nearest town to sell the resources they produced
    - Villagers travel between their village and their bound town/castle to deliver recruits for its garrison

I'll now describe the geography of the kingdom of the Khuzait. Its main characteristics are:
* It is the east-most kingdom within Calradia
* Its east-west territorial width is much narrower than its territorial north-south height
* It is a vast steppe covered by temperate grasslands
* At its southernmost area, its climate starts to resemble a savanna
* At its northernmost area, its climate starts to resemble more tundra-like conditions
* It is bordered to its south-west by the kingdom of the Aserai
* It is bordered to its north-west by the kingdom of Sturgia
* It is bordered to its west by the Northern Empire and Southern Empire factions of the Calradic Empire
* It does not have any land borders to the kingdom of Vlandia
* It does not have any land borders to the kingdom of Battania
* It does not have sea access
* To its east, there is a landmass beyond Calradia. No narrative content can happen there.
* There is a large lake that covers about half of the political border between the kingdom of the Khuzait and the Calradic Empire, called Lake Tanesis
* A large river runs across the northern part of the kingdom of the Khuzait, called the Karakaz River. The river ends at the north tip of Lake Tanesis
* Running down its north to south lands, several mountain ranges mark the landscape. Starting from the north, the Bars Dag mountain range connects to the Sulun Dag mountains when it approaches the east.
* To the west of the Sulun Dag mountains sits the Devseg Plateau. This plateau is at centre of the kingdom of the Khuzait
* South of the Devseg Plateau is Lover's Mountain. It is a small mountain with a nearby small lake, Lake Tsanga Nor, against the mountain's east side
* South of Lover's Mountain is yet another small mountain, but larger than Lover's Mountain. It is called the Kohi Rohini Mountains. It marks that southern third part of the kingdom of the Khuzait and it is the south-most mountain in their lands
* The east side of the Devseg Plateau ends at the Adecan Hills. East of these hills lie Lake Tanesis
* Starting at the southmost point of the Adecan Hills is the Ozu River, which runs south and creates much of the natural border between the kingdom of the Khuzait and the Souther Empire, eventually even separating much of the Khuzait lands from the Aserai lands

* It is located southwest of the kingdom of Sturgia
* It borders the kingdom of Vlandia by three sides: northwest, west and south west
* At its southeast and easter borders is the Southern Empire
* Much of its northeast border touches Sturgia, with only a thin strip of land connecting it to Northern Empire
* Much of Battania is confined to the largest plateau in Calradia, the Uchalion Plateau
* Ailta Druin Cliffs sits at the northern extremity of the Uchalion Plateau
* The Rhennod Hills, which in truth is a true mountain range, sits at the western end of the Uchalion Plateau and serve as a natural border between Battania and Vlandia
* At the northwest end of the Uchalion Plateau, between the Ailta Druin Cliffs and The Rhennod Hills, is the Morcomb Valley, which serves as the only easy way to travel from Battania to northern Vlandia
* Apart from the Morcomb Valley, the only way to enter Vlandian lands from Battania is through the Cafalcombe Valley, which operates as the southwest travel hallway between Battania and Vlandia
* For Battanians, the Cafalcombe Valley also gives access to the Western Empire, as much of the eastern border between Battania and the Western Empire is separated by the mountains that frame the western side of the Uchalion Plateau
* Almost at the very centre of the Uchalion Plateau lies lake Llyn Tywal

* Its entire western border meets the ocean, making it the west-most kingdom in Calradia
* Its territorial north-south length is much greater than its territorial east-west width
* At its northeast, through the Bay of Varcheg, lies Sturgia
* It is located west of the kingdom of Battania
* It is located northwest to the Western Empire
* At its southeast, through the Gulf of Charas, lies the kingdom of the Aserai
* At Vlandia's northwestern territory is the Ebor Peninsula. The peninsula's natural borders are the Bay of Varcheg in the northeast and the Morcomb Valley at its southeast
* The Trand Valley lies south of Ebor Peninsula, sandwiched between the peninsula and Trand River
* East of Trand Valley is Ocspool lake, and east to this lake are the Rhennod Hills
* At its south, the Biscan Hills, which in truth are a mountain range, has the Etir River run west-bound accross its northern face
* The Epiric Hills are the south-most mountain range in Vlandian territory. It creates a valley between itself and the Biscan Hills in the north

I'll now describe the geography of the kingdom of the Aserai. Its main characteristics are:
* It is the south-most kingdom within Calradia
* Its east-west territorial width is much longer than its north-south territorial height
* The Perassic Sea is an inland sea that separates most of southern Calradia from the territories of the Aserai. It opens to the west on the ocean by what is called the Gulf of Charas
* South of the Gulf of Charas is the western-most mountain range in Aserai territory, called the Jabal Tamar Mountains
* The Jabal Tamar Mountains are southwest of the Perassic Sea and the Bay of Ortysia
* The Jabal Ashab Hills are a mountain range in the eastern Aserai territory. It is southeast to the Perrassic Sea
* Northeast of the Jabal Ashab Hills, across a smaller mountain range, is the Nahr al-Kais River, which divides the Aserai territory and the Khuzait territory
* Between the Jabal Tamar Mountains and the Jabal Ashab Hills, and south of the Perassic Sea, is a vast desert territory where many of the Aserai settlements can be found
* There is only one river that truly runs through Aserai territory, almost splitting its desert territory in half. This river runs north-bound until it meets the Perassic Sea
