During this conversation session, I will be discussing things related to a game called "Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord". This game is the sequal to another game, called "Mount & Blade: Warband".
Throughout this conversation session, I will be asking for you to create narrative content for this game called "Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord".
Before I ask anything from you, I will be providing a lot of details about the World in which the game "Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord" is set, its factions, geography, characters and history.

------------------------------------------

First, I would like to describe the World, which is called Calradia.
At the start of the game, it is the year 1084 in Calradia. The world of Calradia takes inspiration from our own world, Earth, during the Middle Ages.
Calradia contains within it 6 kingdoms:
1. The Calradic Empire, also know simply as the Empire
2. The kingdom of Vlandia, also known as the Vlandian kingdom
3. The kingdom of Battania, also known as the Battanian kingdom
4. The kingdom of Sturgia, also known as the Sturgian kingdom
5. The kingdom of the Khuzaits, also known as the Khuzait kingdom
6. The kingdom of the Aserai, also known as the Azerai kingdom

Furthermore, the Calradic Empire is undergoing a civil war and it has been divided into three factions:
1. The Southern Empire
2. The Northern Empire
3. The Western Empire

-----------------------------------------

Here are some general details about the world where Calradia exists:
1. Magic does not exist, but people can be supersticious
2. Only humans exist in Calradia, there is no other race in it
3. Calradia is a fictional world. Earth's historical or modern factions do not exist within Calradia
4. Over the course of Calradia's history, there have been numerous wars and battles fought over territory and resources
5. Caravans are a common sight in Calradia, as they travel between settlements to buy and sell goods, often facing the danger of bandits and raiders on the roads
6. Mercenaries and hired blades can earn a living by protecting these caravans
7. Bandits and raiders are very common, using the instability brought by the Calradic Empire current civil war to wreak havok on the land. Bandit hideouts are therefore scattered across the land
8. The Calradic Empire was once the dominant power in Calradia, but was weakened by internal strife and external threats. Civil war erupted between three factions after the death of Emperor Arenicos
9. Calradia is home to a variety of different religions, with the majority of the population following the faith of the holy order of the Aserai
            LETS CREATE SOME RELIGIONS. ASERAI CAN BE BASED ON EARLY ISLAM, VLANDIA CAN BE BASED ON CHRISTIANITY, KHUZAIT AND BATTANIA ARE MORE TRIBAL, STURGIA IS VERY VIKING AND EMPIRE IS GRECO-ROMAN




Drosios Neretzes from Calradic Empire, died in battle, at age 77 in 1077
In year 1077, a major battle occured near Pendraic. Battle fought between Northern Empire, Southern Empire, Aserai, Khuzait as attacker and Vlandia, Battania, Sturgia as defender. Defenders won the battle
