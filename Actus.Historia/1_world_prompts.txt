During this conversation session, I will be discussing things related to a game called "Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord".
The following are all information pertaining to this game and its game world.

------------------------------------------

First, I would like to describe the continent where the game takes place, which is called Calradia.
At the start of the game, it is the year 1084 in Calradia. The world of Calradia takes inspiration from our own world, Earth, during the 10th and 11th century of the Middle Ages.
Calradia contains within it 6 kingdoms:
1. The Calradic Empire, also know simply as the Empire
2. The Kingdom of Vlandia, also known as the Vlandian kingdom
3. The Kingdom of Battania, also known as the Battanian kingdom
4. The Principality of Sturgia, also known as the Sturgian kingdom
5. The Khuzait Khanate, also known as the Khuzait kingdom
6. The Sultanate of the Aserai, also known as the Azerai kingdom

Furthermore, the Calradic Empire is undergoing a civil war and it has been divided into three factions:
1. The Southern Empire
2. The Northern Empire
3. The Western Empire

-----------------------------------------

Here are some general details about the world where Calradia exists:
1. Magic does not exist, but people can be supersticious
2. Only humans exist in Calradia, there is no other race in it
3. Calradia is a fictional world. Earth's historical or modern factions do not exist within Calradia
4. Over the course of Calradia's history, there have been numerous wars and battles fought over territory and resources
5. Caravans are a common sight in Calradia, as they travel between settlements to buy and sell goods, often facing the danger of bandits and raiders on the roads
6. Mercenaries and hired blades can earn a living by protecting these caravans
7. Bandits and raiders are very common, using the instability brought by the Calradic Empire current civil war to wreak havok on the land. Bandit hideouts are therefore scattered across the land
8. The Calradic Empire was once the dominant power in Calradia, but was weakened by internal strife and external threats. Civil war erupted between three factions after the death of Emperor Arenicos
9. Calradia is home to a variety of different religions

---------------------------------------

Calradia recent history:
Calradia has long been ruled by the Rome-like Calradic Empire. At its peak, all other factions within Calradia were either dominated by the Empire, or allowed to exist by it. But in recent centuries the Empire grows ever weaker. And recently, a batle has put to question weather the Empire will survive or crumble.

The Battle of Pendraic, nicknamed Neretzes' Folly as a form of ridicule, was a major military engagement in the year 1077 involving all major factions in Calradia. The battle was fought between the Empire and Sturgia, with the Aserai and Khuzait siding with the former, and the Vlandians and Battanians siding with the latter.
There is much discrepancy in what actually occurred, but what is certain is that the Empire suffered significant casualties, including Emperor Neretzes himself, whose death would only further accelerate the decline of imperial authority. In the aftermath, Arenicos (who participated in the battle) ascended to the imperial throne. In his rule as emperor, he slowed the Empire's decline that had resulted from the devastating defeat at Pendraic.

Emperor Arenicos was the last undisputed ruler of the Calradic Empire, whose military exploits and careful stewardship of the Empire slowed the Imperial decline that peaked during the Battle of Pendraic. Elected by the Senate to succeed the unpopular Emperor Neretzes soon after the disastrous battle against the Battanian and Sturgian coalition, Arenicos used the rift between Sturgia and Battania to end the war after a series of successful military campaigns as Emperor. Prior to ascending to the Imperial title, he had a senatorial, competent and esteemed reputation — he served as one of Neretzes's most trusted subordinates and commanders. Viewed as the savior of the Empire, a cult had begun to worship him as a partly divine ruler. Arenicos was assassinated before naming his successor, which caused the Imperial fragmentation and Civil War between Lucon (leader of the Western Empire), Garios (leader of the Northern Empire) and Rhagaea (leader of the Southern Empire).
He was the husband of Rhagaea, and the father of Ira. Further, he was the leader of the Pethros clan.

----------------------------------------

Aserai

The Sultanate of the Aserai is one of the kingdoms in Calradia. Ruled by Sultan Unqid, it occupies the shores and the desert beyond the Perassic Sea, to the south below the continent of Calradia. Aserai are based on the real life Arab tribes that existed before the Islamic conquests in the seventh century.

The Banu Asera, also known as Aserai, is a civilization that is comprised of numerous clans who all claim their descent from the legendary patriarch Asera. The clans have occupied the springs, oases and coastline settlements of the Nahasa desert and its surrounding areas since ancient times. Now that the Calradic Empire has become weaker, it has shown an opportunity to the clans, who have formed a confederation in the interests of conquest.

About the lands of the Aserai:
To the south of the imperial heartland lies the Nahasa, the Bronze Desert, ringed by mountains, hammered by the sun. A traveler coming over the passes from greener lands would first see fields of dunes broken by gravel plains and volcanic outcrops, shimmering under the heat haze. But there is water to be found underground, trapped in depressions or beneath the wadis where the occasional flash flood rumbles by. It is in these oases that people have settled. They are divided into dozens of clans and sub-clans, each with its elaborate genealogy, but are collectively known as the Banu Asera or the Aserai after the legendary patriarch Asera, whom they all claim as an ancestor.

Unqid Banu Hulyan is the sultan of the Aserai and the leader of the Banu Hulyan clan. He is owner of the town of Quyaz and Ain Baliq Castle.

The other clans of the Aserai are:
* Banu Sarran, led by Adram. They own the town of Husn Fulq and the town of Razih
* Banu Qild, led by Tais. They own the town of Hubyar, Sahel Castle and Shibal Zumr Castle
* Banu Qaraz, led by Suruq. They own the town of Iyakis and Jamayeh Castle
* Banu Arbas, led by Iyalas. They own the town of Askar
* Banu Atji, led by Talas. They own the town of Qasira
* Banu Sarmal, led by Awdhan. They own Ain Baliq Castle and Uqba Castle
* Banu Habbab, led by Karith. They own Sahel Castle
* Banu Ruwaid, led by Aqar. They own Barihal Castle

The Beni Zilal:
The Beni Zilal are a minor faction of Aserai. They are the self-proclaimed "keepers of the secret" who "watch from the shadows".
The origins of the Beni Zilal, the Sons of the Shadows, are shrouded in legend. Many of the stories tell of a messianic preacher who rule from a citadel deep in the desert, entracing his followers with the help of hallucinogenic herbs and terrorizing the Aserai nobility with the threat of assassination. Regardless of how much truth these stories contain, this brotherhood is now a powerful institution in the deep reaches of the Nahasa, collecting protection money from caravans passing through its territory and cutting deals with local potentates while it awaits the day when it may reveal its hand more openly.

The Jawwal:
The Jawwal, or “Roamers,” are the main bedouin confederacy in the Nahasa desert. They wander from highland to lowland grazing ground, declaring huge swathes of the desert their “territory” in which any caravan must offer protection money. They compose poems of their deeds and mock the other clans of the Banu Asera for giving up the “freedom” of black wool tents for stone houses in the oases. The other clans consider them boastful nuisances, though grudgingly respect them as protectors of the old ways.

The Ghilman:
The Ghilman are a band of mercenaries who recruit from the tribes of southern Calradia and the lands to the east. They are legally their own slaves and masters: each "sells" himself to the order and, in the process, becomes a part-owner. They are known for their fine horses and fine clothes. But no one should assume from their oiled locks, perfumes and peacock feathers that they spend more time preening then training. Their skills as mounted archers are second to none, and as lancers are close behind the Vlandians and the imperial cataphracts.

----------------------------------------

Vlandia

The Kingdom of Vlandia is one of the kingdoms in Calradia. Ruled by King Derthert, it occupies the western forests and coastal plains of the Calradian continent. The Vlandians are based on real life Normans from Normandy during the times of William the Conqueror, Robert Guiscard of Sicily, and the Crusader Bohemond.

The Vlandians originated overseas and came to Calradia as mercenaries and adventurers. They take their name from one of their first warlords Wilund the Bold (Calradic: Valandion). The Vlandians were employed by the Calradic Empire primarily for the use of sieges, utilizing their skill in crossbows and board shields, and paid in land grants and titles, predominately located along the western coast.

During a period of instability in the Empire, Osric Iron-Arm declared himself king of Vlandia, leading to de facto independence. He in turn recognized his lieutenants as barons and counts, granting them suzerainty over their lands in exchange for rallying to his banner in war. Some Vlandian kings have sought to expand the powers of the kingship; others have allowed the barons to feud amonst themselves so long as the money and manpower is there when needed.

Derthert dey Meroc is the King of Vlandia and the head of the clan dey Meroc. He is the owner of the town of Galend, the town of Sargot and Talivel Castle.

The other clans of Vlandia are:
* dey Tihr, led by Baron Aldric. They own the town of Pravend and Drapand Castle
* dey Arromanc, led by Baronnes Calatild. They own the town of Jaculan
* dey Fortes, led by Baron Belgir. They own the town of Ocs Hall and Verecsand Castle
* dey Gunric, led by Baron Ostir. They own the town of Ostican and Tirby Castle
* dey Cortain, led by Baron Ingalther. They own the town of Charas
* dey Valant, led by Baron Servic. They own the town of Rovalt and Caleus Castle
* dey Molarn, led by Baron Hecard. They own Usanc Castle
* dey Jelind, led by Baron Vartin. They own Hongard Castle
* dey Folcun, led by Baron Ecarand. They own Ormanfard Castle
* dey Rothad, led by Baron Berican. They own Usanc Castle

Brotherhood of the Woods:
The Brotherhood of the Woods started out as a Vlandian peasant movement, hiding out in the forests, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. However, they encountered the usual problems that any long-running rebel movement might face - they needed to ensure a steady supply of food, and also ensure that none of the poor would dare earn a bag of coin by informing on them. Slowly but surely, the movement began to make use of extortion, terror, and corrupt deals with the local authorities to survive, becoming little different from any other organized bandit group in Calradia.

Company of the Golden Boar:
The company are Vlandians, mostly local levies who don't adjust well to peacetime and opted for a life of constant warfare. They are probably the least disciplined and most brigandish of Calradia's mercenaries, and a scourge to any bit of countryside where they are allowed to run loose. Still, like all mercenaries, they know that their future earnings depend on their reputation, so they honor contracts and practice their skills, particularly with the crossbow, to ensure their employers receive their money's worth.

----------------------------------------

Battania

The Kingdom of Battania is one of the kingdoms in Calradia. Ruled by High King Caladog, it occupies heavily forested lands in the northwest of the continent of Calradia. The Battanians are based on real life Celtic peoples, in particular from the early medieval times.

Battanian civilization consists of loosely organized clans who originally populated most of the Calradian continent, but has been reduced to a small pocket of free territory after much of their land was conquered by the expansion of the Calradic Empire. Specialties of the Battanian warrior culture include forest warfare, longbowmen, and two-handed swordsmen.

The misty hills of north-western Calradia are dominated by the Battanian clans, the original inhabitants of much of the continent. Their hilltop fortresses have born witness to countless wars fought to resist outside invaders: first the Empire's legions, and more recently the rising Sturgian and Vlandian kingdoms. They are masters of the longbow, the night raid, the sudden wild charge out of the woods. They idolise valour, but especially like it when mixed with a bit of mischief - the cattle thief who can whisk an entire herd into the fog; the champion who dines with a rival tribe, and, regaling his hosts with an anecdote of battle, produces from his bag the skull of one of their kinsmen that he took as a souvenir.

Caladog fen Gruffendoc is the high king of Battania and the leader of the "fen Gruffendoc" clan. He is the owner of the town of Marunath, Rhemtoil Castle and Uthelaim Castle. Before Caladog, Battania was led by High King Aeril fen Derngil, whose disapearence led to the rise of clan fen Gruffendoc.

The other clans of Battania are:
* fen Derngil, led by Chieftain Ergeon. They own the town of Dunglanys and Aster Castle
* fen Uvain, led by Chieftain Melidir. They own the town of Car Banseth and Pendraic Castle
* fen Giall, led by Chieftain Aeron. They own the town of Pen Cannoc
* fen Eingal, led by Chieftain Aradwyr. They own Druimmor Castle
* fen Morcar, led by Chieftain Pryndor. They own Llanoc Hen Castle
* fen Penraic, led by Chieftain Luichan. They own the town of Seonon and Flintolg Castle
* fen Caernacht, led by ???
* fen Uthelaim, led by ???

The Wolfskins:
The Wolfskins are heirs to a long tradition in the Battanian lands wherein great warriors went "wildling" for part of their youth, learning the ways of the woods and how to suffer hardship. So long as a Wolfskin wears no sewn clothes, eats no cooked food, and sleeps under no roof, he is immune from the laws of man. In fact, the modern wolfskins tend to be the sons of wealthy families taking a few years to indulge their feral side, robbing travellers and living viciously and not necessarily hewing to the old code.

----------------------------------------

Sturgia

The Principality of Sturgia is one if the kingdoms of Calradia. Ruled by Grand Prince Raganvad, it occupies the snowy northernmost mountain territories of the continent of Calradia. The Sturgians are based on the real world Kievan Rus', a polity in medieval eastern Europe consisting of Slavic peoples and some Varangians, who were Norse and mixed Norse-Slavic traders, warriors, and adventurers. It was a loose federation of city states, most of whom were located in the area of modern Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

The principality's history began when Nordic traders and adventurers migrated from the northeast territories seeking land and wealth, and eventually formed diplomatic and marriage alliances with the native tribes of the Sturgian region, merging the two cultures together into something new, with a violent, warlike but also mercantile mentality.

The Sturgian forests are forbidding and cold, but great wealth lies within. Wild honey can be found, and bog iron, but the real prize has always been fur. For centuries, brave traders ventured there to buy the pelts of fox, rabbit and ermine from the tribes of the woods. As the empire expanded eastward, that trickle of traders became a flood. Great towns sprung up on the rivers. Fortune-seekers came from the coast, from the steppes, and most of all from the Nordlands. Tribal elders made alliances with the newcomers, sealed by wedding vows, and with their share of the trading profits hired mercenaries to subdue other tribes. Sturgia became a collection of principalities, then a kingdom, the great powerhouse of the north.

Raganvad Gundaroving is the grand prince of Sturgia and the leader of the Gundaroving clan. He is the owner of the town of Balgard, the town of Varcheg, Mazhadan Castle and Nevyansk Castle.

The other clans of Sturgia are:
* Vagiroving, led by the boyar Godun. They own the town of Tyal and Urikskala Castle
* Ormidoving, led by the boyar Yorig. They own the city of Varnovapol and Vladiv Castle
* Vezhoving, led by the boyar Vashorki. They own Ov Castle
* Togaroving, led by the knyaz Vyldur. They own the town of Revyl and Ustokol Castle
* Isyaroving, led by the knyaz Fafen. They own the town of Sibir
* Ubroving, led by the boyar Tovir. They own Takor Castle
* Kuloving, led by the knyaz Olek. They own the town of Omor
* Kostoroving, led by knayz Rolan. THey own Kranirog Castle

The Forest People:
The tribes known as the Forest People practice slash-and-burn farming in the deep woods, outside the grasp of the Sturgian boyars. They burn down tracts of trees, grow crops on the virgin soil fertilized by ash for a few years until the land is exhausted, and move on. It is an inefficient use of land but a very efficient use of labor, suitable for a numerically small population in a large area. Also, because the plots are hard to measure and tax, it's a very good strategy for people who don't care to be governed.

The Lake Rats:
They are dangerous uncaring barbarian plunderers and raiders that operate in the coasts of Sturgia and sometimes in Vlandia. Their hideouts are inside hidden sea caves by the coasts. Because of how they operate and their lack of morality they are universally disliked in Calradia.
The Lake Rats live in the marshes on the shores of the great northern lake, in shacks made out of the timbers of ruined ships. They live by "wrecking" - i.e. luring ships onto shoals with false lighthouses and beacons. Because they're scorned by the rest of Calradia - "all criminals, smell like marsh gas and mud and rotten fish" - they scorn everyone else back. Although mostly Sturgian, their ranks have been swelled by fugitives, debtors, and anyone else who'd rather live by a thieves' code than by the laws of nobles.

The Skolderbroda:
The Skolderbroda, or Shield Brothers, are a mercenary company for those who take fighting and training very seriously. They are primarily Nordic but do allow recruits from other cultures, as long as an already-serving Shield Brother will vouch for them. Their rules are almost monastic: no women in their encampments and no amusements, and no Brother is allowed to spend the night outside without permission. In combat, they fight with spear and axe in the Nordic style and are valued by all the noble houses of the north.
