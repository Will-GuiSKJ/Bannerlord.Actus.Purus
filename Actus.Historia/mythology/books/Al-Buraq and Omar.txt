FROM XYZ...

Once upon a time, in the great deserts of the Aserai, there lived a wise old camel named Al-Buraq. Al-Buraq was no ordinary camel. He had been blessed by the Prophet himself and had the gift of speech.

One day, a young merchant named Omar was lost in the vast desert, his greed and haste caused him to abandon the path. After he had been walking for days without food or water, his caravan destroyed and his poeple swallowed by the desert sands, he was about to give up hope. That is when he came across Al-Buraq.

Al-Buraq, seeing Omar's desperate state, offered to help him find his way. "Jump on my back, young one," said Al-Buraq, "I will guide you to safety."

Omar was amazed to hear the camel speak, but he was too weak to argue. He climbed on Al-Buraq's back, and the wise old camel began to walk.

As they traveled, Al-Buraq told Omar stories about the Prophet and the teachings of Holy Order. He spoke of compassion, charity, and the importance of faith.

Omar was moved by Al-Buraq's words and began to regain his strength. He realized that he had been lost not only in the desert, but in his life as well. He had been neglecting his duties to his family and his community, and had lost his way in the pursuit of wealth and status.

With Al-Buraq's guidance and wisdom, Omar found his way back to his family and his faith. He became a devout follower of the Holy Order of the Aserai, and devoted his life to helping others in need.

And so, the story of Al-Buraq and Omar became a beloved fable among the Aserai, a reminder of the power of faith and the importance of kindness and compassion towards one another.
