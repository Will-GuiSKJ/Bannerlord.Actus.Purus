Recognition of the influence of Aetherism, and the incorporation of some Aetherist concepts, such as the worship of Bellator (god of war) and Fecundia (goddess of fertility and agriculture).
Short History of Ülkentan:

Initially, the Khuzait tribes practiced a form of shamanism, with a strong focus on nature spirits and the worship of Ülken, the sky deity. As the Khuzait Khanate grew and interacted more with the Calradic Empire, the influence of Aetherism began to make its way into their religious beliefs. Some Aetherist deities, such as Bellator and Fecundia, were adopted by the Khuzaits and incorporated into their religious practices.

As the Khuzait Khanate continued to interact with the Calradic Empire, the Ülkentan religion evolved into a unique blend of its original shamanistic beliefs and Aetherist elements. This syncretism allowed the Khuzaits to maintain their cultural identity while acknowledging the impact of the Calradic Empire on their spiritual beliefs.

Today, Ülkentan remains a powerful force in the lives of the Khuzait people, helping to maintain a sense of unity and identity in a rapidly changing world.

The Karakhergit clan, known for their strong adherence to the traditional ways of the Khuzait people, staunchly reject the influences of Aetherism on their faith. They view the Ülkentan religion, with its incorporation of Aetherist elements, as a betrayal of their ancestral beliefs and a departure from the true spiritual path of their people.

As the most conservative and nomadic of the Khuzait clans, the Karakhergit hold onto their original shamanistic beliefs with unwavering devotion. They continue to worship Ülken, the sky deity, and the spirits of nature, while actively rejecting the worship of Aetherist deities such as Bellator and Fecundia.

This rejection of Aetherist influence has led to tension and division among the Khuzait clans. The Karakhergit are often viewed with a mix of envy and contempt by their settled brethren, who have adopted the Ülkentan faith. Despite their disdain for the "new ways," the Karakhergit maintain ties with their fellow Khuzait clans through trade, intermarriage, and occasional cooperation against external threats. However, their unwavering commitment to preserving the old ways of their people keeps them at a distance from the more progressive and syncretic elements of Khuzait society.

Creation myth

In the beginning, there was only the endless sky, and within it, the Great Sky Father, Ülken. Ülken was lonely, so he decided to create the world beneath the vast sky. He descended upon the formless earth and shaped the mountains, rivers, and plains, breathing life into the animals and plants.

One day, Ülken saw his reflection in a still pool of water, and from that reflection, he created the first man and woman, naming them Tural and Ekin. Ülken taught Tural and Ekin how to hunt, grow crops, and build shelters to survive in the new world he had created for them. Tural and Ekin, grateful for their existence and the bountiful world around them, began to worship the Great Sky Father and honor the spirits of nature, including the earth, water, fire, and wind, as well as the spirits of animals, particularly horses.

As Tural and Ekin prospered and their family grew, they understood the interconnectedness of all things, both living and non-living, and the importance of maintaining balance and harmony within the world. Their descendants, the first Khuzaits, spread across the land, each generation passing down the stories of their ancestors and their reverence for the Great Sky Father, Ülken.

However, life was not always peaceful for the Khuzaits. The world was filled with dangerous spirits and rival tribes that sought to disrupt their harmony. But Tural and Ekin's descendants, guided by their personal honor and valor, were able to overcome the challenges they faced. Great warriors and leaders among them earned a special place in the afterlife, their stories becoming an integral part of our faith.

In the Ülkentan religion, the priesthood plays a vital role in preserving the spiritual traditions and guiding the Khuzait people in their religious practices. Unlike the more structured hierarchies found in the Aetherist faith, the Ülkentan priesthood is more decentralized and closely tied to the local communities they serve.

The spiritual leaders of the Ülkentan faith are known as "Kut Shamans," who serve as the intermediaries between the people and the divine realm. Kut Shamans are revered for their wisdom, spiritual insight, and ability to communicate with the gods and spirits. Both men and women can become Kut Shamans, and they are typically chosen based on their innate spiritual gifts, which may be evident from a young age.

Kut Shamans undergo rigorous training in the sacred oral traditions of the Ülkentan faith, learning the myths, prayers, and rituals by heart. They are also skilled in various forms of divination, using methods such as interpreting the flight of birds, the patterns of smoke, or the arrangement of bones to discern the will of the gods and provide guidance to their communities.

Dressed in ceremonial robes adorned with symbolic patterns and talismans, Kut Shamans can be easily recognized by their distinctive attire. Their robes often feature motifs of the sky deity Ülken, as well as representations of the spirits of nature, particularly horses. The headdress worn by a Kut Shaman is also significant, with feathers, beads, and other elements symbolizing their connection to the divine and their role as spiritual guides.

The Kut Shamans perform various religious ceremonies and rites for the Khuzait people, such as blessings for newborns, weddings, and funerals. They also lead rituals to honor the gods and spirits during important festivals and community events. In times of crisis, the Kut Shamans may be called upon to perform rituals to seek divine intervention or guidance, such as rainmaking ceremonies during droughts or protective rites during wars.

While the Ülkentan faith does not have a centralized religious hierarchy, the Kut Shamans maintain a strong sense of camaraderie and mutual support, often gathering for regional meetings or training sessions to share knowledge, experiences, and spiritual insights. This informal network of spiritual leaders helps to preserve the oral traditions of the Ülkentan faith and maintain a sense of unity among the Khuzait people.
