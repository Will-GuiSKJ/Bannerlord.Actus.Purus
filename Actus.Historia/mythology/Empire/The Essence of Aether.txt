In Aetherism, the creation myth tells the story of the birth of the universe and the world as we know it, orchestrated by the divine essence, Aether.

Before the existence of the cosmos, there was only Aether, the all-encompassing, formless force that permeated the void. Over time, Aether contemplated its own nature and decided to bring order to the chaos. Through its will and divine power, Aether started to shape the universe, giving rise to the stars, planets, and celestial bodies that fill the cosmos.

As Aether continued its work, it focused its attention on a single planet, which would later become known as the world inhabited by the Calradic Empire. Aether shaped the planet's landscapes, carving mountains, filling seas, and nurturing lush forests. With the world taking form, Aether breathed life into the planet, creating a multitude of creatures to inhabit the land, sea, and sky.

Aether then created the first humans, sculpting them from the clay of the earth and imbuing them with a fragment of its own divine essence. This act granted humans the unique ability to reason, communicate, and create, setting them apart from other creatures. Aether watched over the fledgling race, guiding them to form communities, harness the world's resources, and develop the foundations of civilization.

Over time, Aether withdrew from direct intervention in human affairs, preferring to guide them subtly through the wisdom and inspiration imparted to select individuals. However, the divine essence remained ever-present, watching over humanity and ensuring the balance between order and chaos was maintained.

The Aetherism creation myth serves as a reminder to the people of the Calradic Empire that their world, and everything within it, is shaped by the divine power of Aether. It also emphasizes the importance of maintaining balance in all aspects of life, as it reflects the order that Aether brought to the universe.
