Holy Text: The Codex Aetherium

Core Tenets:

Pantheon of Deities: Aetherism is a polytheistic religion, with a pantheon of deities that preside over various aspects of life. The chief deity, Aetherius (also called Aether), is the god of the heavens and the ultimate source of wisdom, justice, and order. Other important deities include Bellator, the god of war; Fecundia, the goddess of fertility and agriculture; and Scientia, the goddess of knowledge and learning. The pantheon reflects the diverse aspects of the Calradic Empire and its people.

The Aetherism pantheon is indeed centered around Aetherius, also known as Aether, the divine essence that brought order to the universe and created the world. Aetherius is often depicted as an ethereal, genderless figure, radiating light and energy, symbolizing its omnipresence and omnipotence. As the supreme deity, Aetherius represents wisdom, balance, and harmony, ensuring the order of the cosmos is maintained.

Bellator, the god of war, is a powerful and respected figure in the Aetherism pantheon. He embodies courage, honor, and strength, and is often invoked by warriors and soldiers before going into battle. Bellator is typically portrayed as a tall, muscular man clad in Calradian armor, wielding a sword and shield. His role in the pantheon is to maintain the balance between conflict and peace, ensuring that war serves as a means to restore order when chaos threatens the world.

Fecundia, the goddess of fertility and agriculture, is the life-giving deity of the Aetherism pantheon. She is responsible for the abundance of the earth, the fertility of its inhabitants, and the cycle of life and death. Fecundia is often depicted as a nurturing, motherly figure, surrounded by lush plants, fruits, and animals. Farmers, families, and those seeking abundance in their lives often pray to Fecundia for her blessings. In the pantheon, Fecundia represents the natural world's balance, ensuring that life continues to flourish and renew itself.

Scientia, the goddess of knowledge and learning, is the embodiment of wisdom, curiosity, and the pursuit of truth. She is the patron of scholars, teachers, and students, and is often depicted holding a book or a scroll, symbols of the knowledge she imparts. Scientia appears as a regal, wise woman, wearing a flowing robe and a laurel wreath on her head. Her role in the pantheon is to encourage the growth and dissemination of knowledge, as well as to inspire innovation and progress, helping humanity to maintain the delicate balance between ignorance and enlightenment.

Together, these four deities form the core of the Aetherism pantheon, each representing a different aspect of the balance and harmony that Aetherius seeks to maintain in the universe. Followers of Aetherism pay homage to these gods and goddesses, seeking their guidance and wisdom in their daily lives, and striving to uphold the principles of balance that the pantheon represents.

Civic Virtue: Aetherism emphasizes the importance of civic virtue and the duties of citizens towards their community and the empire. This includes loyalty, courage, discipline, and self-sacrifice. By upholding these virtues, Aetherists contribute to the stability and prosperity of the Calradic Empire.

Senate and Emperor: In Aetherism, the emperor and the Senate are not viewed as divinely appointed, but rather as manifestations of Aetherius' principles of wisdom, justice, and order. The Senate, as a collective body, represents the wisdom of the empire, while the emperor embodies the principle of order and stability. Aetherists believe that the gods favor the empire when the Senate and the emperor work together harmoniously.

Rituals and Ceremonies: Aetherism features numerous rituals and ceremonies, which often correspond to important events in the agricultural and political calendar, such as the beginning of planting season, victories in battle, or the coronation of a new emperor. These rituals involve prayers, offerings, and sacrifices to the gods, seeking their favor and protection for the empire.

Temples and Priesthood: Temples dedicated to the gods are built throughout the Calradic Empire, serving as centers of worship and religious instruction. Each temple is overseen by a hierarchy of priests and priestesses, who are responsible for maintaining the sacred spaces, performing rituals, and providing spiritual guidance to the people.

Afterlife: Aetherism teaches that upon death, the souls of the deceased are judged by Aetherius based on their actions in life. Those who led virtuous lives and fulfilled their civic duties are granted passage to the Elysian Fields, a realm of eternal peace and tranquility. Those who failed to uphold their duties or committed heinous acts are consigned to the Infernal Depths, a realm of torment and suffering.

In Aetherism, the priesthood serves as the intermediary between the people and the gods, ensuring that the gods are properly worshiped and that their teachings and principles are upheld within society. The priesthood is organized into a hierarchical structure, with specific roles and responsibilities assigned to its members.

High Priest/Priestess: At the top of the hierarchy is the High Priest or Priestess, who is responsible for overseeing the religious affairs of the entire Calradic Empire. They work closely with the emperor and the Senate to ensure that Aetherism remains an integral part of the empire's governance and culture. The High Priest or Priestess is often chosen from among the most experienced and knowledgeable members of the priesthood and is considered the ultimate authority on religious matters.

Regional Archpriests/Archpriestesses: Beneath the High Priest/Priestess are the Regional Archpriests and Archpriestesses, who oversee the religious activities within specific regions of the Calradic Empire. They are responsible for coordinating the efforts of local temples, ensuring that religious teachings and practices remain consistent across the empire. Archpriests and Archpriestesses are chosen based on their wisdom, experience, and dedication to Aetherism.

Temple Priests/Priestesses: Each temple dedicated to a specific deity has its own Temple Priest or Priestess, who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the temple, such as organizing rituals, maintaining sacred spaces, and providing spiritual guidance to the local community. Temple Priests and Priestesses are chosen by the Regional Archpriest/Archpriestess and are expected to have a deep understanding of the deity they serve, as well as the religious customs and traditions associated with their temple.

Acolytes: Acolytes are the apprentices within the priesthood, learning the rituals, teachings, and practices of Aetherism under the guidance of more experienced priests and priestesses. Acolytes assist with the daily tasks of the temple, such as preparing offerings, tending to sacred fires, and assisting in the performance of rituals. As they progress in their training, acolytes may choose to specialize in the service of a particular deity or aspect of Aetherism, eventually ascending to the rank of Temple Priest or Priestess.

Scribes and Scholars: A separate group within the priesthood, the scribes and scholars are responsible for preserving and studying the sacred texts of Aetherism, such as the Codex Aetherium. They work to ensure that the teachings and principles of Aetherism are accurately recorded and disseminated throughout the empire. Some scribes and scholars may also serve as advisors to the emperor and the Senate on religious and philosophical matters.

Initiation into the priesthood typically involves a period of study and training, during which candidates learn the history, theology, and rituals of Aetherism. This may be followed by a formal ceremony, in which the initiate swears an oath of service to the gods and the empire, and is officially welcomed into the priesthood. The priesthood is open to both men and women, reflecting the belief that wisdom, virtue, and spiritual insight are not limited by gender.

The Divine Inspiration of Calradios the Great:
The Aetherist faith holds that Calradios the Great, the founder of the Calradic Empire, was guided by the divine will of Aether, the Supreme Deity. According to the myth, Calradios had a dream in which Aether revealed to him the location of a sacred mountain in Calradia. Calradios was instructed to establish his new kingdom at the foot of this mountain and spread the Aetherist faith throughout the land. As Calradios embarked on his conquests, he was said to be protected and guided by Aether's divine wisdom, enabling him to unite the warring tribes and lay the foundation for the Empire.

The Miracle of Emperor Arenicos:
Emperor Arenicos, often considered the last great emperor of the Calradic Empire, is revered in Aetherist mythology for his miraculous victory over the Sturgian-Battanian-Vlandian alliance at the Battle of Pendraic. The myth tells of Arenicos praying to Aether for guidance in the face of overwhelming odds. In response, Aether granted him a vision of a hidden path through the Battanian forests, allowing the Calradic forces to outmaneuver and surprise the enemy. Thanks to Aether's divine intervention, Arenicos was able to achieve a decisive victory and save the Empire from collapse.

The Sacred Flame of Unity:
The Aetherist faith venerates the Sacred Flame, a symbol of unity and the divine power of Aether. According to the myth, when Calradios the Great first established the Empire, he lit a Sacred Flame in the capital city, signifying the unity of the Calradic people under Aether's guidance. The flame was said to burn eternally, its light shining as a beacon of hope and protection for the Empire. It is believed that as long as the Sacred Flame continues to burn, the Calradic Empire will stand united under the watchful eye of Aether.

The Vision of Aether's Garden:
A popular myth among Aetherists is the Vision of Aether's Garden, a paradise reserved for the righteous and virtuous followers of Aetherism. The myth tells of Emperor Arenicos, near the end of his life, receiving a vision of a lush, heavenly garden filled with blooming flowers and crystal-clear springs. In this vision, Aether spoke to Arenicos, promising him that the souls of the faithful would find eternal peace and happiness in the Garden after their time on earth had come to an end. This myth serves as a source of comfort and inspiration for Aetherists, who strive to live virtuous lives in accordance with the teachings of their faith.
