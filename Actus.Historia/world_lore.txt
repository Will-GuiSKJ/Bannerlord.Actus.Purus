During this conversation session, I will be discussing things related to a game called "Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord".
The following are several pieces of information pertaining to this game and its game world.

------------------------------------------

First, I would like to describe the continent where the game takes place, which is called Calradia.
At the start of the game, it is the year 1084 in Calradia. The world of Calradia takes inspiration from our own world, Earth, during the 10th and 11th century of the Middle Ages.
Calradia contains within it 6 kingdoms:
1. The Calradic Empire, also know simply as the Empire
2. The Kingdom of Vlandia, also known as the Vlandian kingdom
3. The Kingdom of Battania, also known as the Battanian kingdom
4. The Principality of Sturgia, also known as the Sturgian kingdom
5. The Khuzait Khanate, also known as the Khuzait kingdom
6. The Sultanate of the Aserai, also known as the Azerai kingdom

Furthermore, the Calradic Empire is undergoing a civil war and it has been divided into three factions:
1. The Southern Empire
2. The Northern Empire
3. The Western Empire

-----------------------------------------

These are some general details about the world where Calradia exists:
1. Magic does not exist, but people can be supersticious
2. Only humans exist in Calradia, there is no other race in it
3. Calradia is a fictional world. Earth's historical or modern factions do not exist within Calradia
4. Over the course of Calradia's history, there have been numerous wars and battles fought over territory and resources
5. Caravans are a common sight in Calradia, as they travel between settlements to buy and sell goods, often facing the danger of bandits and raiders on the roads
6. Mercenaries and hired blades can earn a living by protecting these caravans
7. Bandits and raiders are very common, using the instability brought by the Calradic Empire current civil war to wreak havok on the land. Bandit hideouts are therefore scattered across the land
8. The Calradic Empire was once the dominant power in Calradia, but was weakened by internal strife and external threats. Civil war erupted between three factions after the death of Emperor Arenicos
9. Calradia is home to a variety of different religions

---------------------------------------

Calradia recent history:
Calradia has long been ruled by the Rome-like Calradic Empire. At its peak, all other factions within Calradia were either dominated by the Empire, or allowed to exist by it. But in recent centuries the Empire grows ever weaker. And recently, the Battle of Pendraic has put to question weather the Empire will survive or crumble.

The Calradic Empire can trace its beginnings to a warlord named Calradios the Great, who led a band of exiles northwards into the land that would eventually be named Calradia in order to make a new home for themselves through conquest. His descendants, the Calradoi, became one of the many tribes living in the hills bordering the Southern Sea and the Battanian woodlands.

It is believed Calradios or one of his descendants found the first Calradoi settlement of Charasea which would later be known as Charas. From this place of Calradios' landfall, the Calradoi began to form colonies in the lands around them such as Pravend and Ortysia. Eventually, the Calradoi moved their capital to Pravend. During this early wave of expansion, the Calradoi subjugated their neighbors and forced them to join a confederation of city-states.

The Calradoi were governed by a monarch until its last ruler, the tyrant Cypegos, was slain by Echerion. After this event, the Calradoi were governed by two bodies: an assembly of free citizens who would meet occasionally and a permanent Senate of elders, mostly comprised of the largest landowners. Only when military necessity required it would the Calradoi appoint an emperor to serve as their supreme commander.

Calradios and his descendants conquered many of the natives and incorporated them into the burgeoning nation under the Dragon Banner, many ancient tribes such as the Palaic, Ialoic, Laconians, and Dryatic and assimilated as imperial citizens. The Empire came to stretch all the way from the western coast of Calradia to the Great Grass Sea in the east, the single greatest power on the continent for hundreds of years.

During the years of expansion, emperors were appointed more frequently until they simply remained in office even after the military need was gone. The imperial capital was moved out of Pravend and based where ever the emperor was typically in an army camp. When the free assembly of citizens met with the emperor, the army's veterans could shout down dissenters. The senators grew wealthy and corrupt, moving out into the conquered territories to stake their claim on new landholdings.

The Empire had a policy of keeping the border tribes in a state of disarray: creating clients and allies in the Nahasa Desert and reducing the power of any ambitious Battanian king or nomadic khan through bribes and assassinations. Despite this, the Calradic Empire still experienced its share of conflict with these foreign states, sending imperial legions and hiring Vlandian mercenaries from overseas to continue its expansion and protect their borders.

However, for sometime before the reign of Emperor Neretzes, the Calradic Empire was in a state of decline. Matters of imperial succession often caused a crisis which had to be resolved on the battlefield. A great interregnum struck the Empire in which the most eastern and most western territories fell away and were only ruled by petty kings, governors and generals while the center fought over the crown of the Emperor.

Nearly a century before the events of the game, the Vlandian mercenaries who had settled within the Empire's borders declared their independence under Osric Iron-Arm, seizing control of the capital city of Baravenos (which was later renamed to Pravend) and the rest of the Western Coast. Meanwhile, the steppe and desert tribes united into the Khuzait Khanate and the Aserai respectively, with the Khuzaits pushing west into the Empire and taking its eastern provinces.

During the year 1077, the Empire experienced one of its worst defeats in all its history. An alliance of Sturgians, Battanians and Vlandians had declared war against the Empire and its Aserai and Khuzait allies. Under Emperor Neretzes, the army marched into Battanian lands, culminating in the Battle of Pendraic , wherein the imperials were slaughtered by falxmen, Vlandian horsemen, and Sturgian warriors. Neretzes fell in battle as the imperial camp was stormed by the enemy, with the dragon banner lost and only a handful of soldiers escaping to the safety of imperial territory.

The Battle of Pendraic, nicknamed Neretzes' Folly as a form of ridicule, was a major military engagement in the year 1077 involving all major factions in Calradia. The battle was fought between the Empire and Sturgia, with the Aserai and Khuzait siding with the former, and the Vlandians and Battanians siding with the latter.

There is much discrepancy in what actually occurred, but what is certain is that the Empire suffered significant casualties, including Emperor Neretzes himself, whose death would only further accelerate the decline of imperial authority. In the aftermath, Arenicos (who participated in the battle) ascended to the imperial throne. In his rule as emperor, he slowed the Empire's decline that had resulted from the devastating defeat at Pendraic.

Emperor Arenicos was the last undisputed ruler of the Calradic Empire, whose military exploits and careful stewardship of the Empire slowed the Imperial decline that peaked during the Battle of Pendraic. Elected by the Senate to succeed the unpopular Emperor Neretzes soon after the disastrous battle against the Battanian and Sturgian coalition, Arenicos used the rift between Sturgia and Battania to end the war after a series of successful military campaigns as Emperor. Prior to ascending to the Imperial title, he had a senatorial, competent and esteemed reputation — he served as one of Neretzes's most trusted subordinates and commanders. Viewed as the savior of the Empire, a cult had begun to worship him as a partly divine ruler. Arenicos was assassinated before naming his successor, which caused the Imperial fragmentation and Civil War between Lucon (leader of the Western Empire), Garios (leader of the Northern Empire) and Rhagaea (leader of the Southern Empire). Arenicos was the husband of Rhagaea, and the father of Ira. Further, he was the leader of the Pethros clan. Arenicos reluctance to choose an heir is still debated but no definitive answer exists. This has allowed for many different extrapolations, each supporting different political groups.

----------------------------------------

Calradic Empire

The Calradic Empire, also known as the Calradian Empire or the Calrad Empire, is currently a collection of three kingdoms. Since the death of Emperor Arenicos, The Calradic Empire has been embroiled in the Calradic Civil War, engaged between the Western Empire, Northern Empire, and Southern Empire. The Empire is loosely based on our real world Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire.

The Southern Calradic Empire is one of the civil war factions of the Calradic Empire. Ruled by Rhagaea Pethros, the widow of Emperor Arenicos, who claims the throne for her daughter Ira, the only child of the late emperor. Empress Rhagaea is the ruler of the Southerm Empire and the leader of clan Pethros. She owns the town of Lycaron, the town of Onira, Chanopsis Castle and Sestadaim Castle.

The other Empire clans that have sworn to Rhagaea are:
* Leonipardes, led by archon Pharon. They own the town of Poros
* Mestricaros, led by archon Oros. They own the town of Danustica, Lavenia Castle and Odrysa Castle
* Hongeros, led by archon Turados. They own the town of Vostrum
* Julios, led by archon Baranor. They own the town of Syronea and Corenia Castle
* Vizartos, led by archon Sichanis. They won the town of Phycaon
* Avlonos, led by archon Serandon. They own Melion Castle
* Prienicos, led by archon Abalytos. They own Morenia Castle
* Vetranis, led by archon Satros. They own ??

The Northern Calradic Empire is one of the civil war factions of the Calradic Empire. Ruled by Lucon Osticos, an influential senator and aristocrat who wants the Senate to resume its right to appoint the new emperor. Senator Lucon Osticos is the ruler of the Northern Empire and the leader of clan Osticos. He owns the town of Argoron, the town of Diathma, Atrion Castle and Mecalovea Castle.

The other Empire clans that have sowrn to Lucon are:
* Neretzes, led by archon Penton. They own the town of Saneopa, Varagos Castle and Gaos Castle
* Argoros, led by archon Manteos. They own the town of Epicrotea and Ataconia Castle
* Impestores, led by archon Encurion. They own the town of Amprela
* Dolentos, led by archon Gyphor. They own the town of Myzea
* Chonis, led by archon Nicasor. They own Lochana Castle
* Phalentes, led by archon Tasynor. They own Epinosa Castle
* Vatatzes ??
* Serapides ??

The Western Calradic Empire is one of the civil war factions of the Calradic Empire. Ruled by Garios Comnos, a war hero and military populist who believes the armies should choose the emperor and has named himself Emperor of Calradia. Emperor Garios Comnos is the ruler of the Western Empire and the leader of clan Comnos. He owns the town of Jalmarys, the town of Zeonica and Onica Castle.

The other Empire clans that have sowrn to Garios are:
* Varros, led by archon Apys. They own the town of Ortysia and Garontor Castle
* Elaches, led by archon Tynops. They own the town of Amitatys and Thorios Castle
* Dionicos, led by archon Crotor. They own the town of Lageta and Thractorae Castle
* Lonalion, led by archon Desporion. They own the town of Rhotae
* Sorados, led by archon Saratis. They own Gersegos Castle
* Corenios, led by archon Achios. They own Veron Castle
* Maneolis, led by archon Vipon. They own Hertogea Castle
* Palladios ??

The Embers of the Flame:
The Embers of the Flame is a minor faction of the Calradic Empire. They are the descendants of a rebel movement that rose up nearly a century ago, after the saintly but ineffective teenaged Emperor Darusos was toppled by one of his generals. They claim that they are preparing the way for Heaven to bring back Darusos and usher in a new golden age, but like so many other rebel movements in Calradia they have been forced to turn to extortion to survive.

The Eleftheroi:
The Eleftheroi is a minor faction of the Calradic Empire. The Eleftheroi, the free people, live on the steppelands at the edge of the Empire. Originally the descendants of runaway slaves and debtors, they soon became highly valued by the local imperial commanders for their knowledge of this frontier zone. Their leaders have been granted titles, their young men taken into the retinues of archons and emperors. But although they are loyal to the idea of the Empire, they remain quite hostile to its actual authority.

The Hidden Hand:
The Hidden Hand is a minor faction of the Calradic Empire. They are a mafia who dominate the rural areas, and sometimes the towns, of the southern parts of the Empire. They thrive by making themselves useful to authorities: repressing unrest, silencing troublesome preachers, and robbing from merchants who compete with their patrons. Many of them go back and forth between a respectable life in the towns and a criminal life on the countryside, spending two or three months a year as brigands and enforcers and the rest of the year as "traders" specializing in stolen goods, knowing full well that no one will bother them.

Legion of the Betrayed:
The Legion of the Betrayed is a minor faction of the Calradic Empire. They were created after Emperor Arenicos enacted his reforms, abolishing the last of the Empire's standing armies in favor of archon's private retinues that were significantly cheaper and better at controlling territory. The Legion is made up of men who detested this change: they loved the old army, its standards and its unit histories and its camp life, and they blame the new system for destroying the empire. But an army does not hold together unless it is paid regulary, and they take contracts from imperial and foreign lords alike.

----------------------------------------

Aserai

The Sultanate of the Aserai is one of the kingdoms in Calradia. Ruled by Sultan Unqid, it occupies the shores and the desert beyond the Perassic Sea, to the south below the continent of Calradia. Aserai are based on the real life Arab tribes that existed on Earth before the Islamic conquests in the seventh century.

The Banu Asera, also known as Aserai, is a civilization that is comprised of numerous clans who all claim their descent from the legendary patriarch Asera. The clans have occupied the springs, oases and coastline settlements of the Nahasa desert and its surrounding areas since ancient times. Now that the Calradic Empire has become weaker, it has shown an opportunity to the clans, who have formed a confederation in the interests of conquest.

To the south of the imperial heartland lies the Nahasa, the Bronze Desert, ringed by mountains, hammered by the sun. A traveler coming over the passes from greener lands would first see fields of dunes broken by gravel plains and volcanic outcrops, shimmering under the heat haze. But there is water to be found underground, trapped in depressions or beneath the wadis where the occasional flash flood rumbles by. It is in these oases that people have settled. They are divided into dozens of clans and sub-clans, each with its elaborate genealogy, but are collectively known as the Banu Asera or the Aserai after the legendary patriarch Asera, whom they all claim as an ancestor.

Unqid Banu Hulyan is the sultan of the Aserai and the leader of the Banu Hulyan clan. He is owner of the town of Quyaz and Ain Baliq Castle.

The other clans of the Aserai are:
* Banu Sarran, led by emir Adram. They own the town of Husn Fulq and the town of Razih
* Banu Qild, led by emir Tais. They own the town of Hubyar, Sahel Castle and Shibal Zumr Castle
* Banu Qaraz, led by emir Suruq. They own the town of Iyakis and Jamayeh Castle
* Banu Arbas, led by emir Iyalas. They own the town of Askar
* Banu Atji, led by emir Talas. They own the town of Qasira
* Banu Sarmal, led by emir Awdhan. They own Ain Baliq Castle and Uqba Castle
* Banu Habbab, led by emir Karith. They own Sahel Castle
* Banu Ruwaid, led by emir Aqar. They own Barihal Castle

The Beni Zilal:
The Beni Zilal are a minor faction of Aserai. They are the self-proclaimed "keepers of the secret" who "watch from the shadows".
The origins of the Beni Zilal, the Sons of the Shadows, are shrouded in legend. Many of the stories tell of a messianic preacher who rule from a citadel deep in the desert, entracing his followers with the help of hallucinogenic herbs and terrorizing the Aserai nobility with the threat of assassination. Regardless of how much truth these stories contain, this brotherhood is now a powerful institution in the deep reaches of the Nahasa, collecting protection money from caravans passing through its territory and cutting deals with local potentates while it awaits the day when it may reveal its hand more openly.

The Jawwal:
The Jawwal are a minor faction of Aserai, consisting of Bedouin nomads.
The Jawwal, or “Roamers,” are the main bedouin confederacy in the Nahasa desert. They wander from highland to lowland grazing ground, declaring huge swathes of the desert their “territory” in which any caravan must offer protection money. They compose poems of their deeds and mock the other clans of the Banu Asera for giving up the “freedom” of black wool tents for stone houses in the oases. The other clans consider them boastful nuisances, though grudgingly respect them as protectors of the old ways.

The Ghilman:
The Ghilman are a minor faction of Aserai, they consist of a brotherhood of slave-warriors.
The Ghilman are a band of mercenaries who recruit from the tribes of southern Calradia and the lands to the east. They are legally their own slaves and masters: each "sells" himself to the order and, in the process, becomes a part-owner. They are known for their fine horses and fine clothes. But no one should assume from their oiled locks, perfumes and peacock feathers that they spend more time preening then training. Their skills as mounted archers are second to none, and as lancers are close behind the Vlandians and the imperial cataphracts.

----------------------------------------

Vlandia

The Kingdom of Vlandia is one of the kingdoms in Calradia. Ruled by King Derthert, it occupies the western forests and coastal plains of the Calradian continent. The Vlandians are based on real life Normans from Normandy during the times of William the Conqueror, Robert Guiscard of Sicily, and the Crusader Bohemond.

The Vlandian kingdom, named after the early warlord Wilund the Bold (Valandion, in Calradic), began as a large number of barbarian tribes, who migrated into former Battanian lands during the waning period of the Calradic Empire. The Empire was at war on all sides, so it offered these new barbarian tribes land grants in exchange for mercenary work. Unfortunately, this gave Vlandian nobility a taste for Empire lands, and they united under King Osric Iron-Arm to conquer the far west of the Empire and declare themselves an independent nation.

The Vlandians originated overseas and came to Calradia as mercenaries and adventurers. They take their name from one of their first warlords Wilund the Bold (Calradic: Valandion). The Vlandians were employed by the Calradic Empire primarily for the use of sieges, utilizing their skill in crossbows and board shields, and paid in land grants and titles, predominately located along the western coast.

During a period of instability in the Empire, Osric Iron-Arm declared himself king of Vlandia, leading to de facto independence. He in turn recognized his lieutenants as barons and counts, granting them suzerainty over their lands in exchange for rallying to his banner in war. Some Vlandian kings have sought to expand the powers of the kingship; others have allowed the barons to feud amonst themselves so long as the money and manpower is there when needed.

Derthert dey Meroc is the King of Vlandia and the head of the clan dey Meroc. He is the owner of the town of Galend, the town of Sargot and Talivel Castle.

The other clans of Vlandia are:
* dey Tihr, led by baron Aldric. They own the town of Pravend and Drapand Castle
* dey Arromanc, led by baronnes Calatild. They own the town of Jaculan
* dey Fortes, led by baron Belgir. They own the town of Ocs Hall and Verecsand Castle
* dey Gunric, led by baron Ostir. They own the town of Ostican and Tirby Castle
* dey Cortain, led by baron Ingalther. They own the town of Charas
* dey Valant, led by baron Servic. They own the town of Rovalt and Caleus Castle
* dey Molarn, led by baron Hecard. They own Usanc Castle
* dey Jelind, led by baron Vartin. They own Hongard Castle
* dey Folcun, led by baron Ecarand. They own Ormanfard Castle
* dey Rothad, led by baron Berican. They own Usanc Castle

Brotherhood of the Woods:
The Brotherhood of the Woods is a minor faction of Vlandia. It started out as a Vlandian peasant movement, hiding out in the forests, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. However, they encountered the usual problems that any long-running rebel movement might face - they needed to ensure a steady supply of food, and also ensure that none of the poor would dare earn a bag of coin by informing on them. Slowly but surely, the movement began to make use of extortion, terror, and corrupt deals with the local authorities to survive, becoming little different from any other organized bandit group in Calradia.

Company of the Golden Boar:
The Company of the Golden Boar are a minor faction of Vlandia. The company are Vlandians, mostly local levies who don't adjust well to peacetime and opted for a life of constant warfare. They are probably the least disciplined and most brigandish of Calradia's mercenaries, and a scourge to any bit of countryside where they are allowed to run loose. Still, like all mercenaries, they know that their future earnings depend on their reputation, so they honor contracts and practice their skills, particularly with the crossbow, to ensure their employers receive their money's worth.

----------------------------------------

Battania

The Kingdom of Battania is one of the kingdoms in Calradia. Ruled by High King Caladog, it occupies heavily forested lands in the northwest of the continent of Calradia. The Battanians are based on real life Celtic peoples of Western Europe, in particular, the Picts, Irish, and Welsh of the early medieval era.

Battanian civilization consists of loosely organized clans who originally populated most of the Calradian continent, but has been reduced to a small pocket of free territory after much of their land was conquered by the expansion of the Calradic Empire. Specialties of the Battanian warrior culture include forest warfare, longbowmen, and two-handed swordsmen.

The misty hills of north-western Calradia are dominated by the Battanian clans, the original inhabitants of much of the continent. Their hilltop fortresses have born witness to countless wars fought to resist outside invaders: first the Empire's legions, and more recently the rising Sturgian and Vlandian kingdoms. They are masters of the longbow, the night raid, the sudden wild charge out of the woods. They idolise valour, but especially like it when mixed with a bit of mischief - the cattle thief who can whisk an entire herd into the fog; the champion who dines with a rival tribe, and, regaling his hosts with an anecdote of battle, produces from his bag the skull of one of their kinsmen that he took as a souvenir.

Caladog fen Gruffendoc is the high king of Battania and the leader of the "fen Gruffendoc" clan. He is the owner of the town of Marunath, Rhemtoil Castle and Uthelaim Castle. Before Caladog, Battania was led by High King Aeril fen Derngil, whose disapearence led to the rise of clan fen Gruffendoc.

The other clans of Battania are:
* fen Derngil, led by mormaer Ergeon. They own the town of Dunglanys and Aster Castle
* fen Uvain, led by mormaer Melidir. They own the town of Car Banseth and Pendraic Castle
* fen Giall, led by mormaer Aeron. They own the town of Pen Cannoc
* fen Eingal, led by mormaer Aradwyr. They own Druimmor Castle
* fen Morcar, led by mormaer Pryndor. They own Llanoc Hen Castle
* fen Penraic, led by mormaer Luichan. They own the town of Seonon and Flintolg Castle
* fen Caernacht, led by mormaer(?) Maireas. They own??

The Wolfskins:
The Wolfskins are a minor faction based in Battania. They are a society of young warriors who have left their clans to lead a life of violence and freedom in the wilderness. They live like wolves, eating raw flesh, not sleeping under any roof, not wearing woven cloth and they follow The Code of the Wolf.
The Wolfskins are heirs to a long tradition in the Battanian lands wherein great warriors went "wildling" for part of their youth, learning the ways of the woods and how to suffer hardship. So long as a Wolfskin wears no sewn clothes, eats no cooked food, and sleeps under no roof, he is immune from the laws of man. In fact, the modern wolfskins tend to be the sons of wealthy families taking a few years to indulge their feral side, robbing travellers and living viciously and not necessarily hewing to the old code.

----------------------------------------

Sturgia

The Principality of Sturgia is one if the kingdoms of Calradia. Ruled by Grand Prince Raganvad, it occupies the snowy northernmost mountain territories of the continent of Calradia. The Sturgians are based on our real world Kievan Rus' and share ancestry with the Nords, a group of people from beyond Calradia who themselves are based on the real world Nordic people of northern Europe.

The principality's history began when Nordic traders and adventurers migrated from the northeast territories seeking land and wealth, and eventually formed diplomatic and marriage alliances with the native tribes of the Sturgian region, merging the two cultures together into something new, with a violent, warlike but also mercantile mentality.

The Sturgian forests are forbidding and cold, but great wealth lies within. Wild honey can be found, and bog iron, but the real prize has always been fur. For centuries, brave traders ventured there to buy the pelts of fox, rabbit and ermine from the tribes of the woods. As the empire expanded eastward, that trickle of traders became a flood. Great towns sprung up on the rivers. Fortune-seekers came from the coast, from the steppes, and most of all from the Nordlands. Tribal elders made alliances with the newcomers, sealed by wedding vows, and with their share of the trading profits hired mercenaries to subdue other tribes. Sturgia became a collection of principalities, then a kingdom, the great powerhouse of the north.

Raganvad Gundaroving is the grand prince of Sturgia and the leader of the Gundaroving clan. He is the owner of the town of Balgard, the town of Varcheg, Mazhadan Castle and Nevyansk Castle.

The other clans of Sturgia are:
* Vagiroving, led by the boyar Godun. They own the town of Tyal and Urikskala Castle
* Ormidoving, led by the boyar Yorig. They own the city of Varnovapol and Vladiv Castle
* Vezhoving, led by the boyar Vashorki. They own Ov Castle
* Togaroving, led by the knyaz Vyldur. They own the town of Revyl and Ustokol Castle
* Isyaroving, led by the knyaz Fafen. They own the town of Sibir
* Ubroving, led by the boyar Tovir. They own Takor Castle
* Kuloving, led by the knyaz Olek. They own the town of Omor
* Kostoroving, led by knayz Rolan. THey own Kranirog Castle

The Forest People:
The Forest People are a minor faction based around the Principality of Sturgia, consisting of a semi-nomadic clan that practices swidden agriculture in the depths of the woods.
The tribes known as the Forest People practice slash-and-burn farming in the deep woods, outside the grasp of the Sturgian boyars. They burn down tracts of trees, grow crops on the virgin soil fertilized by ash for a few years until the land is exhausted, and move on. It is an inefficient use of land but a very efficient use of labor, suitable for a numerically small population in a large area. Also, because the plots are hard to measure and tax, it's a very good strategy for people who don't care to be governed.

The Lake Rats:
The Lake Rats are a minor faction based in the Principality of Sturgia. They are dangerous uncaring barbarian plunderers and raiders that operate in the coasts of Sturgia and sometimes in Vlandia. Their hideouts are inside hidden sea caves by the coasts. Because of how they operate and their lack of morality they are universally disliked in Calradia.
The Lake Rats live in the marshes on the shores of the great northern lake, in shacks made out of the timbers of ruined ships. They live by "wrecking" - i.e. luring ships onto shoals with false lighthouses and beacons. Because they're scorned by the rest of Calradia - "all criminals, smell like marsh gas and mud and rotten fish" - they scorn everyone else back. Although mostly Sturgian, their ranks have been swelled by fugitives, debtors, and anyone else who'd rather live by a thieves' code than by the laws of nobles.

The Skolderbroda:
Skolderbroda is a minor faction based in Sturgia, they are a mercenary brotherhood based on our real world's Jomsvikings of the Baltic.
The Skolderbroda, or Shield Brothers, are a mercenary company for those who take fighting and training very seriously. They are primarily Nordic but do allow recruits from other cultures, as long as an already-serving Shield Brother will vouch for them. Their rules are almost monastic: no women in their encampments and no amusements, and no Brother is allowed to spend the night outside without permission. In combat, they fight with spear and axe in the Nordic style and are valued by all the noble houses of the north.

----------------------------------------

Khuzait

The Khuzait Khanate is one of the kingdoms of Calradia. Ruled by Monchug Khan, it occupies the eastern grasslands and steppes outside of the continent of Calradia. The Khuzait are based on the real world peoples of the Eurasian Steppe, Turks and Mongolia that existed during the Classical Era and Middle Ages.

Khuzait peoples were once nomadic tribes who roamed the east borders of the Calradic Empire, until threats from further to the east forced them to band together as a Khanate under Urkhun the Khuzait. This Khanate moved into, and conquered, the poorly defended eastern lands of the Empire. Eventually, these nomadic tribes became settled in the towns and villages they had taken.

A century before the start of Bannerlord, the Calradic Empire extended all the way to the border of the Great Grass Sea. The steppe tribes on the border, which included the Khuzaits, Nachaghan, Arkits, Khergits, and Karakhuzaits, were disunited. The Empire was able to keep the tribes fighting among themselves by bribing chiefs and assassinating khans that were consolidating power.

However, two generations before the start of the game, steppe tribes from the far east pushed westward toward the Empire. Caught between a hammer and an anvil, the border tribes united in a confederacy under Urkhun the Khuzait. This confederation grew in power by conquering and raiding the most eastern extents of the Empire. Taxes and tariffs were levied on these conquered towns and lands. Eventually, the Confederacy became known as a Khanate.

Urkhun ruled the Khuzait Khanate with supreme authority, not allowing vassalized clans to raid or declare war without his approval. This settled and more conventional lifestyle did not sit well with some of the more unruly clans, such as the Karakhergits. After Urkhun's death, his descendants continued to rule. However, many clans felt they should be the ones to rule the Khanate.

The nine-horsetail banner is the symbol of the Khuzait Khanate.

Monchug Urkhunait is the khan of Khuzait and the leader of the Urkhunait clan. He owns the town of Makeb and the town of Chaikand.

The other clans of the Khuzait are:
* Khergit, led by begum Mesui. They own the town of Baltakhand
* Arkit, led by beg Tulag, They own the town of Ortongard and Usek Castle
* Baltait, led by beg Ilatar. They own Dinar Castle and Kaysar Castle
* Harfit, led by beg Akrum. They own the town of Odokh
* Koltit, led by beg Kanujan. They own Simira Castle and Akiser Castle
* Tigrit, led by beg Hurunag. They own the town of Akkalat
* Yanserit, led by beg Taslur. They own Hakkun Castle
* Oburit ??

The Karakhergit:
The Karakhergit are a Khuzait minor faction that keeps to the old ways of the Khuzait (raiding, pillaging and small clans).
The Karakhergit are a nomadic clan that has resisted all efforts by the centralizing Urkhunid khans to keep them in one place, give them farmlands and serfs, and force them to give over taxes and military levies. They are treated by the other clans with a combination of envy and contempt. They trade and sometimes even intermarry with their settled brethren, but they also do a limited amount of kidnapping for ransom and raiding of flocks, and scoff at those who would blame them for carrying on with the heroic old ways.
