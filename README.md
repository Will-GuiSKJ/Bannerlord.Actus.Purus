"Pure Actuality".

## Goal
This project is a mod for Mount &amp; Blade 2 Bannerlord that aims to create a perfected version of the game, in my eyes anyway. Though I plan for this mod to grow and include many facets, its main goal is to provide more Rolepaying content to the game and make the world of Calradia feel more alive.

To achieve such, these are my principles:
1. Keep as much of the core of Bannerlord intact, both as functionality as well as Lore.
2. Keep new functionality simple whenever possible. Complex functionality is hard to test, balance and maintain.
3. Add content to existing system rather than create new ones. Though new systems _may_ be added in the future, the focus is largely on enhancing existing gameplay elements for a more enjoyable experience.
4. Modular. Considering the various systems that will be affected by this mod, being able to turn off each one is important so players can combine Actus Purus with other mods to create _their_ vision of a perfected Bannerlord.

## Features
### New Quests
A lot of the minor quests for Bannerlord are very lackluster when it comes to roleplaying. This mod will be trying to flesh these quests more, not changing how they start or end, but hopefully making their story arc a bit more interesting.

Also, the mod will be introducing a lot of new quests to help make the world feel a little more lived in and add some more reactivity to what is going on in Calradia. A good example of this will be new individual quest chains for each vanilla minor faction in the game, extending their Lore and allowing you an avenue to recruit their troops.

### New Dialog
Bannerlord has a trait system that helps assign personality types to its characters, including you. This mod plans to add more flavour dialogue lines to existing conversations so that you can better roleplay **your** character.

### Events
New world events that can throw Calradia in disaray, from invading foreign factions to plagues, this mods will try to add events that help give the passage of time more meaingful weight.

### Diplomacy Tweaks
TBD.

### Battle Simulation Tweaks
Highly depends on what changes TW makes to the simulations until release, but the goal will be to add some semblance of realism if possible.

### War Strategy Tweaks
TBD.
