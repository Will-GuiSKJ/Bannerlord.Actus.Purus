# Bannerlord.Actus.Purus
["Pure Actuality"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actus_purus)

**Banerlord Supported Version: 1.5.4**

## Goal
This project is a mod for Mount &amp; Blade 2 Bannerlord that aims to create a perfected version of the game, in my eyes anyway. Though I plan for this mod to grow and include many facets, its main goal is to provide Quality of Life features and more Rolepaying content to the game, making the world of Calradia feel more alive.

To achieve such, these are my principles:
1. Keep as much of the core of Bannerlord intact, both as functionality as well as Lore.
1. Keep new functionality simple whenever possible. Complex functionality is hard to test, balance and maintain.
1. Add content to existing system rather than create new ones. Though new systems _may_ be added in the future, the focus is largely on enhancing existing gameplay elements for a more enjoyable experience.
1. Modular & Configurable. Considering the various systems that will be affected by this mod, being able to turn off each one is important so players can combine Actus Purus with other mods to create _their_ vision of a perfected Bannerlord.

## Features

### Character Presets
During Character Creation, you can now cycle through a number of male and female BodyProperties that you define in this mod's `Settings.xml` file.  
Any presets found on the Nexus or copied from Bannerlord character creation screen will work.  
The mod comes with a number of existing presets.

**Disclaimer:** Existing presets were pulled from my favourite Nexus creations and are *not* made by me. If you are one of the authors and wish me to remove your preset or would like me to credit it to you, please PM me.

### Blank Character Creation
When enabled, this will "reset" your character once the **Rebuild Your Clan** quest starts.  
This means all your Attributes and Skills will be set to 0 and all your Focus Points, Perks and Traits removed.  
You are then awarded 20 Attribute Points and 10 Focus Points to spend as you wish.

### Minor Faction Troop Recruitment
All minor factions now allow the player to recruit some of its junior troops through new Dialogs.  
Once your Clan is Tier 3 (or Tier 2 if you are of the same Culture as the minor faction) and once you reach 20 relation with heros of the minor faction, you are able to recruit 20 of the lowest tier troop of that faction for 1000 denars.  
That faction will not allow you to recruit more until you have no more of those troops, meaning those recruits either upgraded or died.  
This is completely generic, meaning this *should* work with any custom minor factions such as those added by the [https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/411](Calradia at War mod).

### Generic Configurations
- Set starting cap of number of workshops for player, at Clan tier 0.
- Set starting cap of number of parties for player, at Clan tier 0.
- Set starting cap of number of companions for player, at Clan tier 0.
- Garrisons are made up of a configurable percentage of units from the settlement's owner's culture
	- Ex: an Empire castle held by a Sturgian lord will have some of its automatically generated garrison units be Sturgian units

### Crafting
- Heroes now restore stamina while moving in the world map, at a configurable rate.
- Configurable Stamina cost multipliers for Smelting, Smithing and Refining.
- Configurable Part Research XP multiplier.

### Passive XP Gain
Each day, several skills are awarded a set amount of XP for the player.
- XP can be awarded to all skills or only to those with Focus Points
- XP can be awarded to player character only or for all adult members of the player's Clan (including companions).
- Configurable Skill Level cap that determines whether a Skill can be awarded XP.
- Each individual Skill can be configurable to receive any amount of daily XP.

## Known Issues

### Character Presets
1. Changing sliders sometimes reverts the body properties to the first preset.
1. Sometimes the preset button stays on screen after closing the character creation screen
1. Changing between genders can sometimes crash to desktop

## Roadmap
For all the features I intend to add to this mod, please see the [https://github.com/Will-GuiSKJ/Bannerlord.Actus.Purus/blob/master/Roadmap.md](Roadmap).

## I Need Your Help!
One of the main things I want to add with this mod is a whole plethora of quests, starting with adding quests to Minor Factions to both flesh them out as well as give reputation so players can recruit their units.  
However, *coming up* with those quests is an exercise in imagination that a can't dedicate too much time to.  
So, if you have ideas for a cool questline for a minor faction or even for anything else please let me know!

## Modder Support
I have spent so many years enjoying the benefits of mods in my games, specially Skyrim, without ever supporting the authors.  
So now that I got into modding, it would be highly hypocritical for me to ask you to support me.

However, if you are one of those awesome people that support your mod authors and you wish to contribute monetarily in some way to this mod, I ask you that you make a donation to a local charity of your choice instead. I am partically partial to animal shelters.
