# Bannerlord.Actus.Purus
"Pure Actuality".  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actus_purus

## Goal
This project is a mod for Mount &amp; Blade 2 Bannerlord that aims to create the perfected version of the game, in the eyes of the author.

To achieve such, these are my principles:
1. Keep the core of Bannerlord intact, both as core functionality as well as Lore
2. Keep functionality simple whenever possible. Complex functionality is hard to test, balance and maintain
3. Enhance rather than create. Though new content _is_ planned, the focus is largely on enhancing existing systems for a more enjoyable experience.
4. Modular. Considering the varius systems that will be affected by this mod, being able to turn off each one is important so players can combine Actus Purus with other mods to create _their_ vision of a perfected Bannerlord.

## Features
### Better Equipment Check
Features a quick way to check if the player's inventory or shop contains better equipment.
This is a simplified version of the great [Best Equip Item](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/369) mod.
